TopFun's rise in popularity back in the '80's can only be attributed to this classic, miniaturized biplane. Populating the mall airspaces moreso than flies around rotting burgers in nearby trash cans, or re-enacting war scenarios as the Latin American gangs duke it out in a good ol' fashioned gang war, it's sure to be just as much of an eye-catcher today as it was back in the day. Speaking both literally and figuratively - the propeller is quite sharp, I tell ya.
