## Translation Notes
- Songs don't really get translated. Some rare exceptions (see: trackid_rsg_dlc.txt) aside. Rockstar Editor SFX rely on trackID, those *do* get translated.
- Radio station names *only* get translated for the Simplified Chinese language. Why, I have no idea.
- Similarly, artist lines with full stops in title (example: "TUNDE ADEBIMPE FEAT. SAL P & SINKANE"), do not have a space after the dot. Also only for Simplified Chinese. And that is not the case for the recent DLC's.

## Notes
- This includes all kinds of radio mods, both public and private, which have their trackID values updated to not overlap with Rockstar or other mods. Compiled separately depending on use.
- For the Community hud.gfx, all strings get compiled into a single trackid.gxt2 file. This is so that people don't have to constantly update their mods any time a different mod is released.
