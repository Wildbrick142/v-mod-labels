Some say that "Less is more" and, clearly, some designer at Coil very much took it to heart while drunk one Friday night. If you ever wanted to blaze past a speedtrap in a pointy brick with the aerodynamics of a super car and more armor than your local military's tanks, now's your chance. This is the automotive future, and it won't let you auto-pilot off a cliff that easily.
