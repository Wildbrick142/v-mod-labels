[VWE_ZR250]
Made too early to fetch six figures as a retro showpiece - made too late to fetch seven figures as a Vinewood star. Still, the ZR250's exceptional design and driving qualities made it a fan favourite among the general population, and a perfect canvas for corner conquerors and superspeed-sideways goers. Forget fart-cans and rusted panels - this born-again grand tourer is ready for war.
